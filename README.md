# Scraper and Data Formatting

This repository contains two Node.js scripts - `scrapper.js` and `setupFormat.js`, that are designed to scrape data from a web page and format it into a new CSV file.

## scrapper.js

The `scrapper.js` script is responsible for scraping data from a specific webpage. It utilizes Puppeteer and Cheerio libraries to automate browsing and extract the necessary information. Here's what the script does:

1. It launches a headless browser using Puppeteer.
2. Navigates to the target URL: "https://www.megamillions.com/Winning-Numbers/Previous-Drawings.aspx".
3. Clicks the "Load More" button multiple times to load more data.
4. Adds a random delay between 5000ms and 7000ms after each button press to make the scraping process less predictable.
5. Extracts the date of the draw and the winning numbers for each draw.
6. Groups the winning numbers into rows, with each row containing 6 numbers along with the corresponding date.
7. Stores the scraped data in a CSV file named "numbers.csv".

## setupFormat.js

The `setupFormat.js` script reads the previously created "numbers.csv" file generated by the `scrapper.js` script. It then processes the data and formats it into a new CSV file named "output.csv". The script follows these steps:

1. It reads the "numbers.csv" file using the fs module.
2. Parses the CSV data into an array, extracting the dates and the corresponding sets of winning numbers.
3. Removes the first element (date) from each row of the CSV data to prepare it for formatting.
4. Formats the data into a new CSV format with each row containing a date followed by six winning numbers.
5. Writes the formatted data to the "output.csv" file.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository and navigate to its directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal.
4. Run the `scrapper.js` script using the command `node scrapper.js`. This will generate the "numbers.csv" file with the scraped data.
5. Run the `setupFormat.js` script using the command `node setupFormat.js`. This will create a new file named "output.csv" with the formatted data.

Make sure to customize the `scrapper.js` script's URL and the number of button clicks as needed to scrape data from different web pages. The `setupFormat.js` script will then work with the generated "numbers.csv" file to format it accordingly.

Feel free to modify the scripts to suit your specific needs or integrate them into your own projects. Happy scraping and formatting!
